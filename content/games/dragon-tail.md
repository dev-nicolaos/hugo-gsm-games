Students form "dragons" by grouping up into groups of three or four. Students must stay attached to their "dragon" group by putting their hands on the shoulders of the person in front of them. Each group is given a bandana that the student in the back must put the in their back pocket with it half-way out. The student in the front leads the "dragon" group and tries to pull the "tails" off of the other "dragons." Only the front student may pull on tails. If a groups tail is pulled off they are out. The last group standing wins. Have the order of the players in each "dragon" rotate in subsequent rounds
