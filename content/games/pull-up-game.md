Works well with larger groups. Everyone grabs a chair and sits in a circle. The teams are boys vs. girls (all leaders can be on one team if needed to even out numbers). Have two boys and two girls start in the middle of the circle. Remove their chairs so four people are always in the middle of the circle. Have the game leader start playing music. While the music is playing the students in the middle will find someone of the opposite gender, take their hand, pull them up, and sit in their chair. This process repeats itself until the music stops. Players must select someone who is at least three chairs away, can only pull up one person at a time, and cannot pull up the person they were pulled up by. Teams are given points based on who is still standing when the music stops. 4 People Point System: 2 Boys / 2 Girls = No points. 3 Gender A / 1 Gender B = +1 Point for Gender B. 4 Gender A = +2 for Gender B. First team to 7 points wins. Students must cooperate when someone selects them to pull up, unless they've heard the music stop, in which case they can sit back down. Tips: If students are being rough with one another? Call them out and tell them to play nice. If a student doesn't want to play? Ask them to keep score on the white board or piece of paper. When stopping the music look away from the students so they don't think you are cheating.
