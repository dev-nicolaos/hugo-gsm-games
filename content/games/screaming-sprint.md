Have everyone line up along a field or large room. When the facilitator says go, all players will run as far as they can. The catch is they may only take one breath and must scream at the top of their lungs while running. When they stop screaming or run out of breath they must stop. Eliminate all players who do not reach a predetermined distance. Have remaining players line up and play again, continuing to eliminate about half each round until you have a winner or a handful of winners.

Game Twist: Split players into teams. Have a lengthy predetermined distance (impossible for only one person to do) and have one player at a time go as far as they can, the next teammate must start where the first one stopped and run from there. They must reach the distance within a certain number of people or start over. The first team to reach the end wins.
