All players stand in an octagonal arena with 2-3 foot walls. Laying 8 folding tables on end is an easy way to make an arena. All players start touching a wall, and a ball is tossed in to the middle. Once the ball bounces twice, play begins. Players try to eliminate other players by hitting the ball at them below the waste. If the ball touches any part of a player below the waist, they are out and must stand on the outside of the octagon. Players may not sit/kneel/lay on the ground as a form of defense, though squatting is fine. If the ball goes outside of the octagon and hits the ground, the last person who touched is out. If a player on the outside catches it before it hits the ground, they take the spot of the last inside player the ball touched. Players on the outside may not reach over the wall to catch a ball. If the ball hits a player on the outside and bounces back into the octagon, no one is out. The last player standing in the octagon wins.
