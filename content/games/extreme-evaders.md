Similar to an obstacle course, setup an area with a defined starting line and end zone. Players are divided into teams and one team at a time runs the field.  Other teams stand on perimeter of the field watching. The goal is to get the most points by getting your team to the end zone. Cones will create running lanes that players must stay within. Opposing team's leaders will stand behind the field perimeter and fire finger rockets & dodge balls at the team on the field. If a player is hit by dodgeball or finger rocket, they are out. They stand on the perimeter of the field. The game facilitator stands at the goal line and counts how many players make it into the end zone without getting hit. Each team should select one person to carry the team flag; if this person makes it to the end zone they count for significantly more points. More roles can be introduced in subsequent rounds. For example, select two team members to be "bodyguards". Bodyguards get shields to protect their teammates, but don't earn points for the team by making it to the end zone. Or give students the option to navigate the course piggy-backing on another student for bonus points. After each team has gone the determined number of rounds, the team with the most points wins. Game Twist: No teams, have all the students run at once, with all the leaders on the outside. Any student that makes it goes back to the start and gets to run the next round. Last student standing wins.
