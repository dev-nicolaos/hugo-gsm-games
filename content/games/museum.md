Select one player or leader to be the night watchman. All other players are statues and choose a spot to start in the playing space. Once they pick a spot, the watchman places a few items around the space. The round begins and the players must complete some task with one of the objects. For example, if playing in a room with a whiteboard, the watchman could place markers which the players would have to retrieve and then use to write their name on the board. Or if in a park, balls could be spread out and the players would have to retrieve one and take it to a certain spot. The first player to complete the task wins the round and becomes (or gets to pick) the next night watchman. The catch is that if the night watchman sees any of the "statues" moving, they eliminate that player, so players must be careful to only move when the night watchman can't see them. If a player has an item when they are caught, the item is dropped where that player was.
