Players line up at one end of playing area. One player (the traffic light) stands at the opposite end and calls out either “green light” (faces away from the crowd) or (faces towards the crowd) “red light”. When Green light is called players run towards the traffic. When red light is called all players must freeze. If a player continues moving/running when red light is called they must return to the starting line. The first player to touch the traffic light wins and becomes the next traffic light. Game Twist: The traffic light can call out other things beside "red light"/"green light" to try and get players to jump.
