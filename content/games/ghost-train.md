Ghost Train is a game that runs itself. Depending on the size of the group, form one or more trains by having students form a conga line. The person in the front of the line is the Train Leader. The Train leader's first job is to move like a train. Trains make wide turns and move slowly. The Train leader's second job is to catch ghosts. At any point, the last person of the train can become a ghost by breaking off and hiding from the train. Only the last person of the train can break off. The train leader can catch ghosts by pretending to shoot them with a finger gun and yelling "Pew pew pew!". Once a ghost is caught they become the new train leader in the front of the train. The train will get smaller over time. The game's only time limit is set by the leader coordinating the game. If all trains disband? Have a leader make a new train.
