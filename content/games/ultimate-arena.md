Basically dodgeball with no separation of the field, use of different projectiles/weapons (balls, finger rockets, pool noodles, etc.) and several barriers in a square arena. Normal dodgeball rules: get hit = out, catch projectile = safe, throw and gets caught = out. Jailbreaks can be called by the game leader. Can be played individually or with teams. INDIVIDUAL: All players in the arena, fighting until last player standing. Players start lined up along the sidelines. You can run ANYWHERE in the play field. Game is played until there is one player left standing. TEAMS: Play tournament style w/4 teams, i.e. teams 1 and 2 play, teams 3 and 4 play, 1st round losers play, first round winners play. Each team stands on a different side of the field. Same rules as individual but no jailbreaks, players can only get back in by teammate catching a projectile or bonus football. The bonus football is thrown into the arena mid-game by the facilitator, who is holding a hula hoop along one of the sidelines. If a player throws the football through the hula hoop, they get 5 players back in for their team. If they are hit before they can throw it they must drop it. If the football goes out of bounds without going through the hoop, a leader can throw it back in.
