Players are divided into teams of equal size, and stand in a line with their team. Each team member is given one or two saltine crackers (the dryer the better). When the game leader says go, the first player on each team must eat their crackers and then try to whistle as quickly as possible. Once they whistle (loud enough to be heard by someone else), the next person in line begins the same task. The team whose last player whistles first wins.
