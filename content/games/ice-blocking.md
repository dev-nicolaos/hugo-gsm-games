Split group into two or more teams. Then within each team have players get into groups of three. This is a relay style race. Give each team an ice block and towel place on top of it. Place a cone a good distance in front of each team. Each team will have their first group get ready by having one player lie on their stomach on the block while the other two players hold their arms. When facilitator says go, the two standing players will run while pulling the player on the ice block, they must pull them to the cone, around the cone, and back. As soon as they get back to the team they switch out and the next group of three goes. The first team to get all of their groups around the cone and back wins. Game Twist: When players reach the cone, have the player on the block get off and switch with one of the pulling players for the return trip.
