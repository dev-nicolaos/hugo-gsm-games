Massive themed event. Students will be divided into three teams and start in the fellowship hall. Each team will have an empty garbage bin at the west end of the sanctuary. The sanctuary, foyer, and all three levels of the CM wing will have small squares of card stock paper spread all over the floor (with exceptions for rooms we don’t want students in). Each team will attempt to find and return as many pieces of paper as possible to their bins during the round. Each student may carry up to five pieces at a time. At the end of each round, leaders will count the number of papers in each teams bin which will eventually be totaled to determine which team is the winner. During the round, leaders will wander the halls attempting to capture students by shooting finger rockets at them. If a student is hit with a rocket they must drop their papers and go to the jail, marked off in the sanctuary. Students may not pick up or use finger rockets. One leader will be a "boss". The boss will roam the facility with some extra power or weapon that will be much harder for the students to escape. A student may rescue another member of his/her team from jail by going to the jail and paying three pieces of the plans to the jail minder. Students will be released in the order they arrived, per team, àla dodgeball rules. Usually a few members of each team will be given something to help protect their teammates. There is also usually a bonus that students can earn for their team during the round. Many of the specific rules and game play features are built around the theme. Past events include: "Go Bananas", "Go Hobbits", Go Star Wars", "Go Mario", and "Go CIA".
