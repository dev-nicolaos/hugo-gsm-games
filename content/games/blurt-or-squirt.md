A student who is "good at talking" is selected to come up in front of the group. The entire group is asked to come up with a topic for the student to talk about. The student will have to talk about that topic non stop for 30 seconds. Any time the student stops talking or says "um", "er", "uh", or something similar, the game leader sprays them with a squirt gun. Multiple students can take turns coming up on stage. To raise the stakes, the game leader can take out a bigger water weapon each time!
