Divide players into teams. Each team then divides into sub-teams of 3. The sub-team gets two pieces of wax paper. Place a cone a distance away in front of each team. This is a relay game. One member of each sub-team stands on the wax paper and the other two drag him/her around the cone and back to their waiting team and sits down. As soon as the first sub-team gets back the next sub-team goes. The first team to have the last sub-team make it around and back wins.
