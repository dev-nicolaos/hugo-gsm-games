Players are split into 2-4 groups and then numbered off within each group. So if there are 40 players and two teams there would be 20 players per team numbered 1-20. Groups then are placed on different sides of playing area. In the middle an object (or objects) is placed. This is the “bacon”. A facilitator then calls out a number and the player with that number from each team races to get the object(s) and get it back to their teams side, earning a point for their team. As play continues, the facilitator may make play trickier by calling multiple numbers, a number range, or a type of number (prime, multiples of 5, etc) thus having more players race for the “bacon”. Game Twist: Players must avoid being tagged by the other team while returning the bacon to their own team.
