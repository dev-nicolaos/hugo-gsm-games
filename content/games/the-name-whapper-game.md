Players sit in a circle. One player is standing in the middle holding a pool noodle. A player sitting in the circle stands up and calls out their own name, then someone else's name and then sits down. The player with the pool noodle tries to hit the player whose name has been called. The player who has their name called must stand and call out their name and someone else's name before they are hit with the pool noodle. If a player whose name is called gets hit before they can call out both names, the hit player then goes in the middle and has the pool noodle and the prior middle person takes their spot in the circle. The former middle person must call a new personâ€™s name before sitting down or they may be hit and placed in the middle again.
