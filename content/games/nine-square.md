Pretty much the same as traditional 4 square, but with a grid of 9 squares instead. The player in the middle square is King or Queen and starts the round by tossing the ball to one of the players in the other squares. This initial toss must be easily playable. Players continue hitting the ball into other player's squares until one player is out. A player can get out by: 1) hitting the ball outside of all 9 squares 2) hitting the ball multiple times before the ball hits anything else 3) hitting the ball into his/her own square 4) having the ball bounce once in his/her own square and then bounce outside of all 9 squares 5) having the ball bounce twice in a row in his/her square, with no other player touching it in between bounces. The player whose it out goes to the back of the line, and everyone who was behind that player moves up one square, with the center square being the "highest" square, and a new round begins. Players must hit the ball rather than grab or throw it (the ball cannot rest on/in a player's hand(s) while in motion). If the ball hits any part of the body it counts as a hit. If there is a dispute as to which player is out, various methods may be used to resolve it including a redo of the round, though generally if someone leaves there square other than to get the ball, it is considered an acceptance of being out.
