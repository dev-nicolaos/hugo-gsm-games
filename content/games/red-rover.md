Players are split into two teams. Each team holds hands in a long line, with one team on each end of playing space. The first team then chooses a player from the other team and yells “Red Rover, Red Rover, send __insert name of chosen player___ on over.” The player whose name is called must run and go between two players on the other team, trying to break their hands apart. The players who he/she runs between must try to remain connected. If the player is successful in breaking through the other players, they may choose a player to bring back to their team with them. However, if they are unsuccessful, they join the team that called them. Teams alternate turns until all players are on one team.
