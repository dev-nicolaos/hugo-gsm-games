Everyone forms a circle with their chairs, making sure that there is one less chair than the number of people playing. Whichever player does not have a chair starts in the middle. Everyone sitting down will pick a fruit (you can either leave it open for everyone to decide or make them pick from three of four options). The person in the middle will call out a fruit and everyone who chose that fruit will get up and run to a new seat at least three chairs away. The person in the middle will also run to a seat. Whoever is left without a seat is the new caller. The caller can at any point call “fruit basket upset”. When this is called everyone must get up and find a new seat.
