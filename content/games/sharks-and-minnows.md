All players line up on the edge of the playing field/room (“ocean”). Select a few players to be the “sharks”. The sharks will yell go and the players ("minnows") must run across the ocean to the other side. Their goal is to make it safely to the other side without getting tagged by the sharks. The sharks goal is to tag as many minnows as possible. If a minnow gets tagged they must stop wherever they are at and they become “seaweed”. As seaweed they may not move their feet, but may move their arms and torso and try to tag minnows that run by them. If the playing space is crowded, have the minnows sit down. Play continues until there is a winning minnow!
