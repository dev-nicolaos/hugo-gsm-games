Similar to capture the flag, players are split into two teams, each of which is given half of the space. Instead of one flag, the team is given 5-8 cones which are placed in a line along the back of their team's territory. The goal is to get all of the cones onto your team's side. If a player is tagged on the opposing team's side, they sit down (instead of going to a jail), and can be rescued by one of their teammates tagging them, at which point both players get a free pass back to their own side. Defenders must remain 5-10 feet away from where the cones are (no puppy guarding). When an attacking player reaches an enemy cone, they may choose to stay there without fear of being tagged, so long as they are touching the cone, and the cone is touching the back line. As soon as they pick it up to run, they are eligible to be tagged again. If a player successfully returns a cone to their side, they must place it on their own back line. If a player with a cone is tagged, the cone remains there and is not returned to the back line. The safe zone rule only applies to cones on the back line, but the puppy guarding rule applies to all cones.
