Get your group split roughly in half and send the halves to opposite ends of the room. Have them line up their chairs or place markers, facing the other side. On “GO!” the groups run across the room, crashing and bumping in the middle, to try to sit in a chair on the opposite side. While the players are running, and before they have a chance to sit down, remove a chair/marker from each side of the room. Players that don’t get a chair are out. They must sit in the middle of the “road” between the two sides. If you’d rather, the players that are out may stand to potentially prevent possible personal injury. Play continues until there is one winner from each side. To speed up the game, remove multiple chairs/markers from each side each turn.
