A variation of volleyball played with dead fish. Split players into two teams, and have each player partner up with a teammate. Each pair is given a trash bag which they will hold stretched out between them. Then the teams use the bags to catch and throw a dead fish back and forth over a volleyball net. If the fish touches the ground, the scoring is like regular volleyball.
