Each player is given a chair and forms columns facing the front of the room. The facilitator is at the front and assigns each column a number or letter. The facilitator calls a column and everyone in that column must get up and run to the front, around the side of all the columns and back into a seat in their column. The facilitator also runs, thus leaving one player without a seat. They then go up to the front and call a different column and the process repeats. The caller can call one or multiple columns. If the caller yells "train wreck!" then every column gets up and runs, and players may take a seat in any column.
