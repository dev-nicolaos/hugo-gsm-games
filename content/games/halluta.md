Very similar to kickball, but with a few twists. Players are divided into two teams, one team in the field, one team kicking. Everyone on the kicking team will get a chance to kick each half-inning, the so the teams switch after the final kicker. Players score a point for their team by crossing home plate. However, rather than being done when crossing home, players may continue on to first base and keep running the bases until they are tagged out. Players must yell "Halluta" at the top of their lungs when crossing home plate, and may not stop at home in between kickers, they must run all the way to first or go back to third. There is no limit to how many runners can be on one base at a time. Depending on time, you can play one or two full innings, and the team with the most runs wins.
