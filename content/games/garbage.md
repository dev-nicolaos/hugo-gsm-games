Divide players into 3-4 teams. Use false walls or other tall barricades to separate the teams from one another. Give each team a large number of balls and other soft items. When the facilitator says go, each team tries to get rid of all their "garbage" by throwing it over the barricades into the other team's zones. The first team to empty their zone of garbage wins. If no team achieves this, the team with the least amount of garbage at the end of the time wins.
