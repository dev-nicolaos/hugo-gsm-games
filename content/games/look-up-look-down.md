Arrange participants into groups of 12-20 members. Have participants stand in a tight circle, shoulder to shoulder. When you say "look down" everyone must look at the ground, and when you say "look up" everyone must look up and stare directly at the face of another person. If two people look up and stare at each other, they each "lose" (have to cover) one eye. The rest of the participants who didn't make eye contact with another person will continue staring until the facilitator says, "look down" again. If a player loses both eyes they are eliminated and must step out of the circle. Play continues until there are only 1 or 2 people left in the circle.
