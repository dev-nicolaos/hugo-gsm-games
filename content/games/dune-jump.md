Meant to be played at the beach. Leaders find and/or build a sand dune. Players (divided into teams) then take turns running and jumping off the dune, each attempting to go as far as possible. The longest jump for each team is marked. Players must jump from behind a designated line marked in the sand, failure to do so results in disqualification of the jump. Players may jump again after all participants have had a chance. Jumps are measured by the furthest back mark the jumper makes in the sand. For example, if a jumper initially lands on their feet, but falls back onto their butt, the jump is measured to the butt mark. Points are awarded to each team based on the place of there longest jump.
