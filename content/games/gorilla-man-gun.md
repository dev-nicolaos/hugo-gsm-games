A variation of Rock, Paper, Scissors, may be played with any group size. Players pair up and stand back to back. Facilitator starts the rhyme of “Gorilla beats man, man beats gun, gun beats gorilla, if you tie you die. One two three.” After three, players turn around and act one of the three options: man (scratching chin), gun (either hand pistol or acting like holding a rifle), or gorilla (hands over head in a gorilla like fashion). Following the rules of the rhyme, losing players sits down, if a tie both players are out. Winners find a new partner and play continues until there is one person left.
