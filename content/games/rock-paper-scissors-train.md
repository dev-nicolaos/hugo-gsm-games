Each person finds a partner and plays rock, paper, scissors with them. The loser must stand behind the winner with his hands on the winners shoulders and chant the winners name. The winner will then find another winner (with the loser still attached to them). The loser of that match will link on the back of the winners train and anyone who was on their back will follow and they will all chant the new winners name. This continues until there is one winner and a long train.
