Your basic king of the hill game. Put an inflated paddle raft a short distance from shore (ideally in water 2-3 feet deep), upside down. Players all start on the raft and when the facilitator calls game start, all players attempt to push or throw other players off of the raft. If a player falls into the water they may get back on the raft and continue playing or they may attempt to pull players off the raft. When a player is the only one on the raft, they get points for how long they are standing without anyone else on the raft. At the end, whichever player stood alone the longest wins! Stress safety as a priority when explaining.
