All players are asked to find a same gender partner. Upon finding a partner, the facilitator should find some way of distinguishing who is the "birdie" and who is the "perch". The "perches" then form a circle and the "birdies" form a larger circle around them. When the music starts, the circles walk in opposite directions so that partners are no longer together the whole time. The facilitator then stops the music and the "birdies" and "perches" need to find their partners as fast as possible. The "perch" should get down on one knee and the "birdie" should sit on the "perch's" raised knee. The last few pairs to find one another and assume the "birdie on a perch" position are eliminated from the game. Rounds are repeated until one pair wins. Game Twist: Can also play by calling out body parts to touch such as “elbow to nose!”
