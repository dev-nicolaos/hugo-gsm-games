Players start sitting in a circle all facing inward. One person is selected and stands up in the middle of the circle, leaving one empty chair in the circle. The person in the middle tries to sit in the empty seat. The people sitting down have to slide to the empty chair to their side. If the person gets in the seat then whoever was suppose to move now is in the middle. While playing, leader yells switch and the group changes the direction they were moving. Game Twist: Have multiple people in the middle and/or multiple openings in the circle.
