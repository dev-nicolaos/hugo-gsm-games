Form groups of about 10 people each. Have each group stand facing each other shoulder to shoulder in a circle. First, have everyone stick their left hand out into the circle. Then have them grab someone else's left hand with their right hand. Make sure that no one is holding hands with the person directly next to them, and that they aren't holding both hands with the same person. To play, the groups must communicate and figure out how to untangle the knot (forming a circle of people) without ever letting go of any hands.
