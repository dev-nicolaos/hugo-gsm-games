Players choose a partner and link arms. The pairs then space out and stand in a large circle. One set of players is chosen to start. One is “it” and chases the other player in a tag-like fashion. The player being chased may choose to link up with any pair standing around the circle. When they link up with someone, the player who is already linked to that player must break off and the player who is “it” must now chase them. If the tagger tags the player they are pursuing, play reverses and the tagged player is now “it” and the other is now running away. Once the group has the basics down, more pairs can be released to chase. Game Twist: Have players get into groups of three and have pairs stay linked while chasing/running. When pair links up with a group of three, the end two break off and remain linked to each other while running.
