Players stand in a circle, with one player selected to start sitting in the middle. The players on the outside bump a volleyball or other softball amongst themselves. After three or more bumps or sets have been made, someone on the outside may try to hit the person(s) in the middle with the ball. If they succeed and then the ball hits the ground or an outside player, the round is over and a new one begins. If at any point during a round, the player(s) in the middle catch the ball, they are out of the middle and the last outside person to touch the ball is now in the middle. If the ball hits the ground without hitting the player in the middle (whether in passing or in an attempt to hit the player(s) in the middle), the last outside player to touch the ball joins the group in the middle. A player may avoid this if it was clearly another outside player's fault that the ball hit the ground,in which case that player would go into the middle instead. This decision is highly subjective and usually left up to the group or involved parties to work out.
