All players stand in a circle and on the count of three, step back and strike a ninja pose. Players MAY NOT MOVE unless it is their turn or they are dodging. Choose a player to start. This player may either change position or attack another player by attempting to hit one of their hands. Either type of move must be done in one fluid motion. If a players hand gets hit, their hand is out and they must keep it behind there back and may no longer use it in game play. If both of a players hands get hit, they are out of the game. Play continues one by one, going clockwise based on where the players originally started the game. If a player is attacked, even if it is not their turn, they may dodge the attack by moving in one fluid motion. Play continues until one player is left standing.
