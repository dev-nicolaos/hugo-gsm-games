One person is “the king” and the rest of the players split into teams of about 5 people. The king will then ask for specific items from the group (i.e. a nail file, a key to a Toyota, an iPod playing a popular song, a shoe from every member in the group, etc…). The groups will then send one member as a representative of their group with the requested item. Whichever team reaches the king with the correct item first wins. This game can be played with points, or just for fun.
