Have players spread out in a large space. The facilitator will yell out a number between 1 and 5. If he says #1, everyone has to lie down on their back as fast as they can and sizzle like bacon. #2 means that everyone needs to find a partner to do a piggy back with. #3 means that everyone needs to find 2 other people to do a pyramid with. #4 means that everyone needs to find 3 other people to line up, sit down with, and pretend to be rowing a canoe with. #5 means that everyone needs to find 4 other people to make a star with by raising up and putting their hands together. Everyone will try to fulfill these commands as fast as possible. If they take too long, canâ€™t find the right amount of people (too many or too few),or if do the wrong command, then they will be out. There will be leaders watching to judge whether people are out or not. The game continues until you have a winner. The numbers can be repeated, said as many times as one desires, and can be out of order (all highly encouraged). When a person is out, they go to the outskirts of the room to watch.
