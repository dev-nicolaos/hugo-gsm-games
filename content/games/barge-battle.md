A one on one duel for supremacy on the high seas! Setup an inflatable raft upside down in 2 to 3 feet of water. It's usually best to leave a little give in the raft (i.e. don't pump it up to 100% firmness). Select 2 students (same gender, similar size or age) from opposing teams and give each a helmet, life jacket, and jouster. Example jouster: PVC inside a pool noodle, with bubble wrap around the ends and the whole thing covered in duck tape. The combatants stand on opposite ends of the raft. Have at least one leader in the water per raft, to help stabilize it a little. When the facilitator says go or blows an air horn, the combatants try to knock/wrestle each other off the raft. The first one off the raft loses. Points are awarded to teams based on their overall win percentage. Game Twist: Have the leader(s) in the water shake or spin the boat.
