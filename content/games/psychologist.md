Pick one or two members of the group to be "psychologists". Have them step outside the room and have the rest of the group decide on one "condition" that all players will have. The condition can be anything: medical, social, or totally crazy. Some example conditions include: all players are pregnant, all players are shy, all players are on a pirate ship, all players are a different member of the group, etc. Creativity when choosing a condition is highly encouraged. Once the group has decided, have the psychologist(s) return. The psychologist(s) must ask questions of the group and try to guess what their "condition" is. Players should answer in character, but not so obvious as to make it too easy for the psychologist(s). Here is an example where the "condition" is that each answer begins with the next letter of the alphabet. Question: Amber, what is your favorite color? Amber: Any color really Question: Mike, what did you do yesterday? Mike: Booked a vacation Question: Tanya, what did you have for lunch? Tanya: Cauliflower and Carrots Once the person thinks they have the condition figured out they can diagnose it â€“ and once it is diagnosed correctly then they choose a new psychologist who leaves the room and a new condition is decided upon. They may guess as much as they like and continue asking questions until they have it.
