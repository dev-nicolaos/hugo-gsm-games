Split players into two teams and divide the playing space in half. Place dodge balls along the dividing line and have each team wait at the back of their side. When the facilitator says go, the teams may run to get the balls and play begins. Optionally, the facilitator may give players a 5 second safety window to retrieve the balls without fear of getting hit. Players try to hit members of the opposing team with balls while staying on their own side. If a player gets hit with a ball they are out (unless they get hit in the head) and must form a line on the sideline with their other teammates who are out. Players may deflect balls with a ball they are holding. If a player catches a ball thrown at them the thrower is out and the first player in the catching team's "out line" may rejoin the can. If the ball bounces on the ground it is dead even if it hits a player after the bounce. The referee may choose to call jail break at anytime, in which case everyone who was out is back in the game. The team to eliminate all members of the opposing team wins. Game Twist: Mushroom style, no teams and no sides. If a player gets out they take note of who got them out and may return to the game when that player gets out. In this mode, players may only take 3 steps while carrying a ball.
