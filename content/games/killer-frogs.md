Have all players sit in a circle. The facilitator secretly chooses a few players to be killer frogs. Play begins and players look around the circle and make small talk with one another. The killer frogs try to inconspicuously kill players by sticking their tongue out at another player while making eye contact. If a player is killed he/she falls to their death in the middle of the circle. Players try to guess who the frogs are during the course of the game. If a player guesses correctly, the frog dies, but if they guess wrong the guessing player dies. The round ends once all the frogs are dead or are the only ones remaining. Game Twist: Frogs kill by winking at a player while making eye contact rather than sticking out there tongue.
