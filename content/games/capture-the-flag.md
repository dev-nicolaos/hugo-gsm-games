Also known as 'Capture the Noodle' when using pool noodles as flags. Divide a large playing area into two sides and players into two teams. Be sure to clearly mark the dividing line so players can easily tell. Mark off a small "jail" somewhat deep into each team's territory. Each team is given a flag and must hide it somewhere in their area, making sure that nobody from the opposing team can see where it is. Flags must be hidden in a place where it can actually be seen, not under a car, buried in a bush, or up in a tree. Teams are given a few minutes to hide their flags, and the game begins. In order to win the game, a player must capture the other team's flag and bring it back to their team's territory. If a player ventures onto the opponent's side, they may be tagged and sent to that team's jail. Players can escape jail by being rescued by a teammate who makes it all the way to them in jail without being tagged. If this happens both the rescuing player and the rescued player must return to their own side immediately, but cannot be tagged while doing so. The game facilitator may also call a jailbreak, thereby freeing all prisoners on both teams. If a player is tagged while carrying the other team's flag, the flag can either be placed back at its original location or left where the player was tagged; the facilitator should make this decision before the game begins. Defending players should not stand within 10-15 feet of their flag unless chasing an opponent (no puppy guarding).
