For any size group. Split into two teams. Each team huddles as a group and determines a play (rock, paper, or scissors). Both teams then line up in the center of the playing field facing each other. A facilitator counts to three and then both teams act out their play. (Scissors = Cutting motion with arms. Rock = growl and put arms in front in a roundish shape as if flexing. Paper = Arms straight above head.) Rules follow similar rock, paper, scissors. Rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, paper beats rock. The winning team must then try to tag players from the other team while the losing teams tries to make it safely back to their line without getting tagged. If a player is tagged they join the other team and teams re-gather for next round. Game Twist: Tagged players are out rather than join the other team. Play continues until one team is eliminated.
