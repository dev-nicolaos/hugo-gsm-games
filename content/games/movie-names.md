Group sits in a circle. One player (the contestant) will leave the room, while the rest of the group comes up with a movie title, preferably a longer movie title (e.g. “Back to the Future”). Split up the title into its individual words, and divvy the words up in order around the circle, (i.e. 1 player has “back,” another has “to,” a third has “the,” and another has “future.”) The contestant comes back in, and asks questions of those in the circle. Whenever a question is asked of a player that has a word assigned to him or her, he or she must use the word from the movie title in the answer. Example: Contestant – “[Player 4], what’s your favorite color?” Player 4 – “Silver! It’s the color of the future!”
