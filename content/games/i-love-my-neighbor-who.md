Everybody grabs a chair and makes a giant circle. One person is chosen to start out in the middle, their chair is removed, and they say something like “I love my neighbor who... is wearing red”. Anyone who is wearing red has to get up and switch to a different seat (but not one of the seats right next to them). The person who does not get a seat now stands in the middle and says “I love my neighbor who... _____” and fills in the blank.
