Have players stand in a wide circle with two people in the middle. One person in the middle is the President, the other is the Bodyguard. The players in the circle have a soft dodgeball, and try to hit the President with it. The bodyguard may jump, squat, dive, etc in order to deflect the ball before it hits the President. If the ball touches the President at any time, the person who threw the ball (or the last person to touch it) then becomes the bodyguard, the bodyguard becomes the President, and the President goes back into the circle. What makes this exciting is that from the moment the President is hit, the new President is vulnerable because the transition is instantaneous. The new bodyguard must be fast at getting into the circle to defend him or her. This sometimes makes presidential turnover pretty quick, but it's exciting. Game Twist: Add multiple balls and/or bodyguards.
