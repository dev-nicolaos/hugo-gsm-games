Players are split into two teams and are all sitting (leave one empty seat). There are four seats in a row designated as “the couch” (there may be an actual couch, or you can just call four chairs in a row “the couch”). To start, each team should have two players on “the couch.” Each player writes their name on a slip of paper which are then mixed and randomly handed out to the players. It doesn’t matter if you get your own name. The person sitting to the right of the empty seat says the name of someone in the game. Whoever holds the slip of paper with that name on it moves to the empty seat. Play resumes with the player next to the newly-emptied seat. Each time a player moves, have them switch papers with the person who called them. Players may not call a name that has been called the last two turns. Continue until all four spots on “the couch” are occupied by one team.
