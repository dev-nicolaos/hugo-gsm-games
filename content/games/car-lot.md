Very similar to sharks and minnows. Divide players into 4 groups and send each group to one corner of the space. Name each group a different type of car, then select 2-3 players from the entire group to be "car salesmen". The car salesmen stand in the center. The facilitator calls out 1 or 2 car types, and those groups must run to the corner opposite of the one they are currently in. The car salesmen try to tag the players as they run. If tagged, the player must sit down and can try to tag others but may not move to do so. If the facilitator calls "Car Lot!" all players run. The last player not to be tagged wins.
