Players sit in a circle and everyone comes up with a sign for themselves. Scratch your cheek, flip your hair, etc. Go around and demonstrate your sign for the group. One person will start and silently pass their sign along without the designated person in the middle catching you doing the sign. Players receive the sign by first doing their own sign, then pass it by doing another person's. Once that person does their own sign, they now have the sign and must pass it. Players may continue to do the other person's sign if the recipient didn't see it. Players have to watch carefully as the sign can move quickly. If the person in the middle finds out who has the sign, that person is now in the middle.
