Before the game, designate each corner of the room a number 1-4. One person is selected to be the "picker" and they are placed in the middle of the room with their eyes covered. At the beginning of each round, players have 10-30 seconds to go to one of the corners of the room, depending on the size. After the time seconds is up, the picker says one of the numbers. Whoever is in the corresponding corner is eliminated from the game. Players then have the same amount of time to select a new corner. The picker then again says one of the four numbers. This process continues until there is only one player left. Game Twist: For large groups, have only the players in the selected corner remain, and eliminate the players in the other three corners.
