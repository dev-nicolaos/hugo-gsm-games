Before play, designate a narrator. Hand every other player a playing card representing their role. Depending on group size, have 1-2 doctors, 1-3 mafia, and 1-2 policemen, everyone else will be townspeople. Shuffle and pass out the cards and make sure that no one shows anyone else their card. The narrator then asks everyone to go to sleep. At this point everyone closes their eyes and puts their heads down. The narrator then asks for the mafia to wake up. All the mafia silently look up and open their eyes. The narrator asks who they want to kill, and they silently all point and decide on one person to kill. The narrator then asks the doctor(s) to wake up, they all silently “wake up”. The narrator asks them who they want to save. They must silently decide to save one person from the mafia. The narrator then tells them to go back to sleep and has the policemen wake up. The narrator asks them who they think the mafia is, they all silently agree on one person and the narrator nods yes or no to indicate if they are correct. The narrator then has them go back to sleep and asks everyone to wake up. Everyone wakes up and the narrator tells a funny/dramatic tale of how whoever the mafia chose to kill dies. However, if the doctors chose to save the right person their tale will not end in death. Then the narrator facilitates a mock trial as the players try to guess who is the mafia, once a “suspect” is chosen, the group votes and if the majority is a yes, that player is dead whether they are mafia or not. At that point they may tell the group what their role was. If the majority is no, they choose another suspect. Once the trial is done, the narrator tells everyone to go to sleep and the next round begins. If all the mafia are caught, the townspeople win, if the mafia are the last one alive, they win. "Dead" people may watch but not give away any information.
