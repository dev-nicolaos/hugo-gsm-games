Ask everyone to sit in groups. Once each group has been given paper and a pen/pencil, the game leader tells each team to get a player ready who is going to start. The game leader leaves the room and wanders the building (or a portion of it). When the game starts the first player runs to find the game leader to get the first word. The player then runs back to his/her team and tries to draw that word out. When any of his/her teammates guess the word, a different player can run to the game leader to get the second word and repeat the process. The team that draws and guesses all of the game leader's words first is the winner.
