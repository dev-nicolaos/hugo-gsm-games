Split group into two teams and have them line up in single file lines. Have a volunteer from each team stand a little in front of the line and cover their face with whip cream. The teams then work through the line, each player throwing a cheeto and trying to make it stick to their teammate's face. The winning team is the one that gets the most to stick.
