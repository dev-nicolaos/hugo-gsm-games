Divide players into two teams and have them stand in a line at one end of the playing area. Give each team 3 or 4 large markers. At the other end of the playing area, setup a large 9 square grid. When the facilitator says go, the first person on each team takes a marker, runs down and places into a square on the grid. They run back and the next person on their team repeats the process. The first team to get three markers in a row wins the round. Once all markers are on the grid, players must move one their team's markers each trip down.
