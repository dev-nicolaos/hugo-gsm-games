Players line up single file from a given line in front of a basketball hoop. The first two players are given basketballs. The first player shoots from the line and continues shooting (from anywhere after the first shot) to try and make a basket. The second player does the same, beginning as soon as the first has taken his/her initial shot. If the second player makes a basket before first, the first player is out of the game. However, if the first player makes a basket before the second player, they pass their ball to the next player in line and that player then tries to eliminate the player still shooting. Play continues until there is a winner. Players are allowed and encouraged to bump the other shooter's ball away from or out of the hoop with their ball in order to increase their own odds.
