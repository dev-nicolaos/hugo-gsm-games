Form circles of 6-8 people. The starting person will toss a ball to anyone in the group who will then toss it to someone new, other than those standing right next to them. This will continue until everyone has been tossed the ball once. The last person will toss the ball back to the starting person. If you drop the ball you must start over. After going around once or twice in the same order, introduce multiple balls, keeping the order of who gets thrown to and if at any point a ball drops you must start over with all the balls.
