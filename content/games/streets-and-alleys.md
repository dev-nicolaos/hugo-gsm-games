Players are divided into lines of 8-10, and line up arms length apart with their arms outstretched, forming rows (or streets). Two players are selected to run, one designated the chaser. The chaser chases the other player up and down the "streets" formed by all the other players. When the facilitator calls "alleys!" all the players rotate 90 degrees to form new rows (alleys) with the people who were behind and in front of them. This completely changes the playing field, potentially putting the chaser very close or very far away from the runner. The facilitator may yell "streets" or "alleys" as often as they like, changing the playing field each time. If the chaser tags the runner, the runner becomes the chaser and the former chaser chooses a nearby player to become the new runner. As play goes on the facilitator can add a second or third pair of runners/chasers to give more players the opportunity to run.
