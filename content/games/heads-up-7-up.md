Seven students are chosen as it. The rest of the room closes their eyes and lowers their heads. The seven go out and each tap one person on the head. Then the seven return to the front of the room and say "heads up seven up" and everyone looks up. Each student who got tapped on the head gets one chance to guess which of the seven touched him/her. If they guessed right than they changed places and become one of the seven. If they do not the same person gets to stay up.
