Groups of 10-20 players form circles and choose one start person. That person will turn to the person on their right and ask a question. The person who they asked must respond with “My grandmother’s big fat toe”. The person who answered will then turn to the person on their right and ask a new question, to which the person asked must respond “My grandmother’s big fat toe” and so on. The trick is that you cannot smile or laugh while asking, answering, or being asked a question. If someone does so they are out. If someone repeats a question that has already been asked they are out. Players must make eye contact when asking or answering a question. If someone hesitates before answering they are out, though giving a more elaborate answer that includes the phrase is acceptable. Last player standing wins.
