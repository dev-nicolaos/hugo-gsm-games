Create a circle of chairs facing outwards. There should be a few less chairs than the number of people playing. Have players walk in a circle around the chairs while music plays. Players may not "hover" above a chair until the next one "opens up", but must continue walking at all times. When the game leader pauses the music, everyone must sit down in a chair. Anyone who can't find a chair is eliminated. Remove a few chairs after the round and repeat until there is only one player left.
