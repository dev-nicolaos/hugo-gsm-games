Players are divided into two teams, and each team lines up along one side of a playing area. The playing area has a goal at either end and soccer ball is placed in the middle. Players are numbered off within their team. A facilitator then calls out a number and the player with that number from each team run onto the field and attempt to score by kicking the ball into the other team's goal, earning a point for their team. As play continues, the facilitator may make play trickier by calling multiple numbers, a number range, or a type of number (prime, multiples of 5, etc) thus increasing the number of players on the field. Players on the sides may also kick the ball, but only if it comes to them, as they cannot cross the sideline. The team with the most points after the last round wins.
