Everyone will get into groups of 3-5 people. Groups form a large circle in the room, with the game leader on the outside. The game leader will then specify a setting (i.e. the park, school, mars, christmas time, etc…). The first group will run onto the “stage” (the area directly in front if the game leader) and have five seconds to silently perform an action that relates to the specified setting. The leader will try to guess what they are doing in the five seconds. If the leader guesses in the time limit the group is still in. If the leader does not guess in the time limit or if the group repeats an action that has already been performed they are out. The teams that are in continue to move around the circle, as each team runs on stage for their five seconds. The winner is the team last standing.
