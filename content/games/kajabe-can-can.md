Players stand in a circle holding onto a small length of rope with each player next to them. One or more empty garbage cans are placed in the middle of the group. Players must try to pull other players into the garbage can without touching it themselves or letting go of the ropes connecting them to the other players. If a player touches the can, they are out. If the connection between to players is broken, whoever let go of the rope is out. Last player standing wins. Illegal moves include pushing or tripping another player or yanking the rope out of their hand. When a player is out, pause the game and reconnect the circle. Consider separating groups by gender, depending on the group.
