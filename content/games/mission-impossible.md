Classic Glenwood night game. Split the students into 2-4 teams. Each team is assigned a different color of flagging tape, and each team member will have a small length tied onto their wrist so that it is visible. Hidden somewhere on the property, a leader will be waiting to collect the tape from the students. The student's goal is to find this leader and give him/her their wristband. If they succeed, they may return to the starting point, get another wristband, and attempt to find the leader again. The catch is that the other leaders will be roaming and sneaking around, trying to catch the students before they make it to the designated leader. These leaders catch the students by shining their flashlight on them. The leader can then take the student's wristbands or they can make them do something silly like sing Justin Bieber at the top of their lungs as "payment" and then let them go free. Coming up with creative "payments" is highly encouraged. If the leader is not feeling generous and takes the studentâ€™s wristband, then the student can go back to base where a leader will give them another wristband. Students may only have one wristband at a time. Glow sticks can be hidden throughout the playing area. If a player finds it and delivers it to the designated leader, they earn X number of points for their team. Glow sticks should be carried in the open, not stuffed in to a pocket or under a shirt, making it harder for students to be sneaky. At the end of the time, all the lengths of tape and glow sticks successfully delivered are counted up and the team with the most points wins.
